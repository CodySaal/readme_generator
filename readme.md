# README Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project is to generate a high quality readme quickly for any future projects. This project automates the process so all the user has to do is input the data that would change from projec tto project. While building this project I learned how to implement npm modules as well use node in general.

## Installation

A user can either clone or download the code from the repository. Once the code is aquired the user can open the file within VScode or their preferred code editor.

## Usage

To use the project, once the code has been opened in a text editor, install the necessary dependencies by running "npm install". Then from the terminal all the user has to do is run "node index.js" and the program will run. The user will answer the following questions and after the last question is answered a high-quality readme will be generated.
